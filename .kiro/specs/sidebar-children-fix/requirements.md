# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current sidebar component has issues with its children logic and layout that need to be addressed. The sidebar should properly handle nested menu items with smooth interactions, correct positioning, and responsive behavior. The current implementation has problems with hover states, positioning of child menus, and overall user experience when navigating through nested categories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see nested menu items displayed correctly when hovering over parent categories, so that I can easily navigate through the component hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a parent menu item THEN the system SHALL display its children in a properly positioned submenu
2. WHEN I move my mouse away from a parent item THEN the system SHALL hide the submenu after a brief delay
3. WHEN I hover over a child item that has its own children THEN the system SHALL display the nested submenu to the right
4. IF a submenu would extend beyond the viewport THEN the system SHALL adjust its position to remain visible
5. WHEN a category has up to 3 levels of nesting (parent -> child -> grandchild) THEN the system SHALL display all levels correctly in desktop mode
6. WHEN navigating through deeply nested categories THEN the system SHALL maintain proper z-index stacking to ensure menus appear in the correct order

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions and visual feedback when interacting with menu items, so that the interface feels responsive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submenus appear or disappear THEN the system SHALL use smooth CSS transitions
2. WHEN I hover over menu items THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback with color changes
3. WHEN submenus are loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate skeleton loading states
4. WHEN I click on a menu item without children THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar to work properly on both desktop and mobile devices, so that I can access the navigation regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL show the full sidebar with hover interactions
2. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL hide the desktop sidebar and show only the mobile trigger
3. WHEN the sidebar is hidden on small screens THEN the system SHALL use the `max-sm:hidden` class correctly
4. WHEN submenus extend beyond screen boundaries THEN the system SHALL handle overflow appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sidebar component to handle API data efficiently and avoid unnecessary re-renders, so that the application performs well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL fetch menu data only once
2. WHEN the API call is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading skeletons
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN menu data is received THEN the system SHALL properly structure hierarchical data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent styling and proper spacing throughout the sidebar menu, so that the interface looks professional and is easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN menu items are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent padding and margins
2. WHEN submenus are shown THEN the system SHALL have proper borders and shadows
3. WHEN menu items have different nesting levels THEN the system SHALL indent them appropriately
4. WHEN hovering over items THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent hover states across all levels
