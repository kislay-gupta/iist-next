# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Child Scientist Card component currently displays images that may not be properly contained within their container. This feature aims to fix the image containment issue in the ChildScientistCard component to ensure all images are properly displayed with consistent dimensions and aspect ratios, regardless of the original image size or aspect ratio.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see properly contained and consistently sized images of child scientists, so that the website looks professional and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ChildScientistCard is rendered THEN the system SHALL display the image fully contained within its designated area without stretching or overflowing.
2. WHEN images of different aspect ratios are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent card dimensions without distortion.
3. WHEN a user views the child scientist carousel THEN the system SHALL ensure all images have the same visual weight and importance.
4. WHEN an image is loaded THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate object-fit properties to maintain aspect ratio while filling the available space.
5. WHEN a user hovers over a card THEN the system SHALL maintain proper image containment during any hover animations or transitions.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable image card component with proper containment, so that I can use it consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ChildScientistCard component is used in different sections THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent image containment behavior.
2. WHEN the component receives images of varying dimensions THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the layout.
3. WHEN the application is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL ensure images remain properly contained and responsive.
4. WHEN new child scientist images are added to the system THEN the system SHALL apply the same containment rules without requiring additional styling.
